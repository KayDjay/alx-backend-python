Advanced Python Concepts: Type Annotations and Validation
This project dives into Advanced Python concepts, specifically focusing on type annotations and validation.

Resources:

Python 3 Typing Documentation: https://docs.python.org/
MyPy Cheat Sheet: Briefly explore a MyPy cheat sheet to gain a basic understanding of its functionalities.
Learning Objectives:

By the end of this project, you should be able to:

Explain type annotations in Python 3:
Grasp the concept of type hints and how they provide information about expected data types for variables and function arguments/return values.
Utilize type annotations:
Learn the syntax for adding type annotations to function signatures and variable declarations.
Understand Duck Typing:
Recognize that Python utilizes duck typing, where objects are classified by their methods rather than their declared type.
Validate code with MyPy:
Implement MyPy, a static type checker, to identify potential type errors in your code.
Expected Outcome:

Gain a solid understanding of type annotations and their role in enhancing code clarity and maintainability.
Effectively use type annotations to improve code readability and catch potential errors during development.
Acknowledge the concept of duck typing in Python's type system.
Leverage MyPy to validate your code and ensure type correctness.
Note: This README provides a foundational overview. Throughout the project, you'll delve deeper into these concepts through practical exercises and examples.
